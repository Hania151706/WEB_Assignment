## 🎨 Pixelay Comparison

We used **Pixelay** to compare the coded layout against the Figma design.  

### Steps:
1. Exported the Figma desktop design as PNG.  
2. Opened Pixelay extension in Chrome.  
3. Uploaded both the **Figma PNG** and the **live site screenshot**.  
4. Compared layouts with **overlay** and **diff mode**.  

### Notes:
- Minor pixel differences exist due to font rendering and Tailwind spacing defaults.  
- Tradeoff: Used Tailwind utilities instead of exact Figma values in a few places (e.g., padding/margin adjustments) for responsiveness.  
- Hero section background image had slight cropping differences on smaller viewports.  

---

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs & Decisions

- **Responsiveness:** Focused on desktop-first (per assignment) but also tested for tablet/mobile.  
- **Tailwind:** Preferred utility classes over inline styles for maintainability.  
- **Assets:** Images were imported into `~/assets/images` for proper bundling.  
- **Pixel perfection vs practicality:** In some cases, exact pixel values were adjusted for cleaner responsive breakpoints.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The landing page design from Figma was **successfully implemented** in Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + TailwindCSS.  
Pixelay verification confirmed layout fidelity with only minor acceptable differences.
